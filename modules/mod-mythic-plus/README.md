# Mythic Plus Module for AzerothCore
📣 **long overdue update**: This has been a passion project and relaxing output of my time. I was laid off, had to get surgery, then get a real job again at a high demand start-up that has uses up all my programming energy.

I also took a pause on this to build out some new action based mechanics for encounters, really early days on that and experimental.

I expect to come back to working on this project in a few months when as I am really getting the itch to revisit and **finish this**.

So what does that mean?

**Do the boring stuff**:
1. upgrade everything to latest version of npc bots and patch any problems.
2. start a fresh version not modified version and install as well as script a custom installer for the sql needs.
3. Write thorough docs on how to install this.

**Finish the content:**
1. Finish the remaining NPC trainers for new leveling tradeskills and make them more accessible.
2. Retool the items one final time simplifying the sprawl that happened while I iterated on item creator.
3. Add in the legendary and ascendant paths I always intended to complete

That list seems short but it is not, low effort or small amount of time I assure you.

Once I have checked those off... I am going to call this done.

I will fix bugs and put into maintainer mode, so only upgrading from new patches down from acore trickerrer, as I can.

👊 If you want to help me accomplish this to make it happen faster and have some programming skills or cash for AI credits to generate code, please DM me on discord, I am in all the WoW channels.

Look forward to completing this project and giving it to the rest of my nostalgic gamers out there.

🚨 **This is not mythic like in retail.** 🚨

This module started with the intention of creating a retail-like mythic plus system but has evolved into something unique. Instead, think of it as an **expansion of existing Wrath to new end game conte r** that reuses much of the existing dungeons and creatures, overhauling them to much higher difficulties with new loot mechanics.

## Overview

The Mythic Plus module transforms existing World of Warcraft dungeons (Wrath of the Lich King to add additional endgame content) into challenging, scaled encounters with progressive difficulty levels, enhanced rewards, and unique gameplay mechanics to extend gameplay experience.

## Features

### Core Systems
- **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: Multiple tiers of difficulty that scale creature stats, abilities, and rewards
- **Player Advancement System**: Custom advancements for mythic plus progression, completion times, and special challenges
- **Voiced NPCs**: Enhanced immersion with voice acting for key NPCs and encounters
- **Dynamic Loot System**: New loot mechanics with scaled rewards based on difficulty completed
- **Death Penalty System**: Configurable death penalties that affect progression
- **Time-Based Challenges**:
- (In progress)

### Massive Content Expansion
- **50,000+ New Items**: Completely new item database with scaled equipment for all difficulty tiers
- **New Rare Materials**: Custom crafting materials and rare drops exclusive to mythic plus content
- **Reworked Tier Gear**: All expansion tier sets completely reworked and rebalanced for mythic plus scaling
- **Cross-Expansion Integration**: Unified progression system spanning Vanilla through Wrath

### Difficulty Tiers
The module supports multiple difficulty levels with configurable scaling:

- **Mythic Dungeons**: Base enhanced difficulty with improved creature stats and new rare material drops
- **Legendary Dungeons**: In progress
- **Ascendant Dungeons**: In progress

### Per-Dungeon Customization
- **Database-Driven Scaling**: Each dungeon can have unique scaling values configured through database tables
- **Individual Encounter Tuning**: Specific creatures and bosses can have custom multipliers independent of global settings
- **Dungeon-Specific Materials**: Unique rare materials and rewards exclusive to certain dungeons or difficulty combinations

### Creature Enhancements
- **Health & Damage Scaling**: Configurable multipliers for different difficulty tiers

- **Voiced Encounters**: Important NPCs and bosses feature voice acting for enhanced immersion

- **Cross-Expansion Itemization**: Unified item progression that spans all supported expansions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
-- Trickerer Acore or Azerothcore
- MySQL database 8.4
- C++ compiler with C++20 support
- docker for most tested experience
- companion lua scripts **more details coming here**

### Build Process

1. **Clone the repository** into your AzerothCore modules directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
   git clone https://github.com/araxiaonline/mod-mythic-plus.git
   ```

2. **Rebuild AzerothCore** with the module:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/azerothcore/build
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

3. **Install database changes**:
   Database changes will be installed using azerothcores built in script, if it does not you can use the following commands below:

   ```bash
   # Apply the SQL files from data/sql/ in the correct order
   # Note: This includes extensive item database additions (50,000+ items)
   # and achievement system integration
   mysql -u username -p acore_world < modules/mod-mythic-plus/data/sql/db-characters/*.sql
   mysql -u username -p acore_world < modules/mod-mythic-plus/data/sql/db-world/*.sql

   # Verify the massive item additions were applied successfully
   # The module includes a complete item database overhaul
   ```
